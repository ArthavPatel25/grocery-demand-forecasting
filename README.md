- **Test Coverage**: 74% (13 automated tests)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with ML model serving
- **Frontend**: Streamlit interactive dashboard
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with docker-compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, flake8 linting, isort import sorting

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker Desktop
- Git

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grocery-demand-forecasting.git
cd grocery-demand-forecasting
2. Run with Docker (Recommended)
Start both API and Streamlit services:
bashdocker-compose up -d
Check container status:
bashdocker-compose ps
3. Access the Application

Streamlit Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
API Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

4. Test the API
Health check:
bashcurl http://localhost:8000/health
Make a prediction:
bashcurl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "store_id": "ST_001",
    "product_id": "PR_1001",
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "price": 5.99,
    "promotion_flag": 1,
    "chain": "Loblaws",
    "province": "ON",
    "category": "Dairy",
    "brand": "TestBrand"
  }'
5. Stop the Application
bashdocker-compose down
Development Setup
1. Create Virtual Environment
bashpython -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
2. Install Dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Tests
bashpytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html
4. Run API Locally
bashuvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
5. Run Streamlit Locally
bashstreamlit run src/ui/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501
